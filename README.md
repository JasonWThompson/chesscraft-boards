# ChessCraft Boards

A little known fact about me is that I'm rather mediocre at Chess. However, I have recently discovered a game called [ChessCraft](www.chesscraft.ca) that allows players to create their own chessboards and pieces. Using the editor, I'm designing boards that will help me get better by allowing me to practice the fundamentals. This page will list off the boards so that you may import them into your copy of Chesscraft as well.

Below I have linked to the boards. I've also saved the JSON files here just in case the ChessCraft site disappears some day.
